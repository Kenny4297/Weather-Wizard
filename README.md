## Description
An enhanced weather dashboard that shows the local time and weather / forecast of any city across the globe.

## Motivation
I challenged myself to create a superior Weather Dashboard beyond the scope of the Minnesota Coding Bootcamp requirements. The original dashboard had several limitations, and I believed that additional features would enhance its functionality. As a result, I expanded upon the existing design to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies
OpenWeather API:
The OpenWeather API is a web-based service that provides weather data and forecasts for various locations around the world. It allows developers to access real-time and historical weather data in a programmatic way, using HTTP requests to retrieve JSON or XML responses. The API provides a wide range of weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and more. It also includes features such as historical data retrieval, weather alerts, and UV index forecasts. 

React-bootstrap:
React-Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first web applications using React. It is built on top of the Bootstrap framework and provides pre-built UI components, such as buttons, forms, modals, navigation bars, and more, that can be easily integrated into React applications. React-Bootstrap components are designed to be customizable and flexible, allowing developers to adapt them to their specific needs and styling requirements. Additionally, React-Bootstrap includes support for accessibility features and cross-browser compatibility, making it a reliable and accessible choice for building user interfaces.

## Features
The user can enter any city across the globe and see the local time, the current weather (including the temperature, skies, humidity, low / high, wind speed ), along with the next 5 day forecast. 

## Deployment
Due to this portfolio being a SPA, I have decided to simply use GitPages for the deployment. Site URL comming soon!

## Troubleshooting
React-Bootstrap offers effortless responsiveness across all screen sizes, yet at times, its built-in classnames proved counterproductive to my intended design. I found that its simplicity also presented a challenge, as making small adjustments or overriding the built-in styling was sometimes difficult. Despite these challenges, React-Bootstrap remains a popular choice for developers seeking a versatile and user-friendly front-end framework.

## Testing
Coming soon!


If you have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them with me! Thanks for viewing this README!
